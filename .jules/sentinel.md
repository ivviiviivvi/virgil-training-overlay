### Log Injection Prevention
- **Date**: 2024-05-22
- **Context**: Outputting application names to stdout.
- **Threat**: An application could have control characters in its name, potentially messing with the terminal or downstream log processors (Log Injection).
- **Mitigation**: Sanitized the `NSWorkspace` output by filtering out `CharacterSet.controlCharacters` from the application name before printing.
